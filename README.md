# AREP-Lab2
# Web Server

This project implements a simple web server that supports multiple consecutive requests without concurrency. It is designed to read local disk files and return them upon request, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, CSS, and images. Additionally, a web application is created to test the server, which features asynchronous communication with backend REST services.
## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through obtaining a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes
### Prerequisites

To run this project, you must have Java installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install Java and Maven (which is used for managing dependencies).
1. **Install Java:**

    Download and install the Java JDK (version 11 or higher). You can follow the instructions on the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. **Install Maven:**

   - Maven is used to manage project dependencies. You can download and install Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

   - After installation, verify if Maven is correctly installed by running: mvn -v. This should show the installed Maven version.
  
### Installing
> [!NOTE]
> You should perform the following steps from a Bash terminal or PowerShell on Windows.

o set up your development environment:
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CristianAlvarez-b/AREP-Lab1
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
   cd AREP-Lab1
```
3. **Build the project with Maven:**
```bash
   mvn clean install
```
  This will compile the code and package it into an executable JAR file.
4. **Run the server:**
```bash
   java -jar target/HttpServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
   The server will start and listen on port 35000 by default. You can now access the web server `http://localhost:35000`.

### Running the Tests
Automated tests are included to ensure the server and web application functionality.
> [!NOTE]
> You should test in a diferent Bash terminal or PowerShell on Windows.
1. **Ejecutar pruebas unitarias:**
   Run unit tests: To run the automated tests, use the following Maven command:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
   This will run all the unit tests and show the results in the terminal.
